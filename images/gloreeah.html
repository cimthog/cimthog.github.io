            <h1>Happy Birthday Gloreeah! ðŸŽ‰</h1>

            <p>Hey Gloreeah Omotosho Deborah, my dear friend, sister and co-labourer in God's vineyard...</p>

            <p>It's a beautiful day to reminisce how long we've come. The entry point was being an evangelism partner
                (amazingly, one of the brothers we reached out to then, Bro Rasheed, who spoke in tongues is already in
                500lvl now, still saw his status this morning and he's doing well in his church)</p>

            <p>Then from the conversation after service that Sunday, meant to be for few minutes but it spanned into
                hours till we went to pray together.</p>

            <p>It's been beautiful memories and memories afterwards. Sharing words of prophecies, encouragements, taking
                up challenges, book reading, ensuring to stay fit and healthy (my personal nurse). The constant "how was
                prayer meeting today? How was outreach today?" I guess ours passes the true test of friendship.</p>

            <p>Your life has been a testimony of God's goodness, mercy and faithfulness. None of His goodness can you
                deny. You've grown and keeps growing. You've learnt and keeps learning. I love how you allow God's word
                transform you. I love how you often quote Pastor.</p>

            <p><span class="emphasis">Leader ma</span>, God has increased your capacity greatly and He's just starting.
            </p>

            <p>Yes, Deborah, He's just starting. Woman of fire, there's more for you to do in God. In God's wisdom, He
                uses the weak to confound the wise and strong. You're a nation taker, mountain mover, giant slayer. So,
                you lean on His unending source of strength. Keep the enemies perplexed, set them in disarray. Warrior
                woman, keep your knees bended.</p>

            <p>And your days will not be few. You'll yet see more and more and more. I know you do have desires (not
                cravings ðŸ˜‰). He will do them. I know you have doubts and fear. Be of good cheer! He says. He makes all
                things beautiful in his time.</p>

            <p>Here's a toast to the BIG 21! ðŸ¥‚<br>
                Odun ayo<br>
                Odun idunnu<br>
                Odun to ma gbe nkan rere se<br>
                21 hearty cheers to this beautiful soul (not just soul, Gloreeah is a spec ðŸ‘Œ)<br>
                Hip hip hip, hurrah!!!ðŸŽ‰</p>

            <p class="highlight">You know I really do love you ðŸ¥°, baby girl, let's do an amazing year together ðŸ¤—</p>
